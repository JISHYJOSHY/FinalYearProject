Modify game speed for fast evolution (Note, can cause accuracy / physics problems if higher than 70%, but is useful to skip a lot of learning.
Uses Unity WebGL, so Chrome will suffer if speed goes higher than a certain percentage.
New Track will generate a new race track with the same AI steering the vehicles.
New Species will wipe the AI and cause them to re-learn the track.
The '}' button will perform both New Track and New Species.

Thanks
